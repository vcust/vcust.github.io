            <p>While the Census Bureau's terminology for metropolitan areas and the classification of specific areas changes over time, the general concept is consistent: a metropolitan area consists of a large population center and adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social interaction.  </p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>WT06 provides ATUS respondent weights based on the weighting methodology introduced in 2006. WT06 is available for all years and is the preferred weighting variable to use for most analyses.  It is the only weighting variable that is suitable for use in analyses that combine time use data from 2006 and later with data for earlier years.  The methodology used to construct WT06 ensures that the sums of the respondent weights add up to the appropriate number of weekday person-days and weekend person-days over the quarter, both for the population as a whole and for selected subpopulations. </p>
            <p>All ATUS weights are probability weights. Users should take care to specify them properly in their statistical packages.</p>
            <p>Because the ATUS sample is not a simple random sample, standard errors calculated using the default options in most statistical packages will not be correct.  Calculation of correct standard errors requires the use of replicate weights.  RWT06 may be used in conjunction with WT06 for this purpose; for further details, see the description of RWT06.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>WT20 provides ATUS respondent weights compatible with the partial-year 2020 data collection. WT20 does not yield annual estimates. It is designed to provide estimates that are representative of the period from January 1 through March 17 and May 10 through December 31. This weight omits the March 18 to May 9 period because 2020 data were not collected on these days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This weight is required for analyses that include 2020 data. </p>
            <p>All ATUS weights are probability weights. Users should take care to specify them properly in their statistical packages.</p>
            <p>Because the ATUS sample is not a simple random sample, standard errors calculated using the default options in most statistical packages will not be correct.  Calculation of correct standard errors requires the use of replicate weights.  RWT20 may be used in conjunction with WT20 for this purpose; for further details, see the description of RWT20.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>BMI provides a measure of body mass index.  Body mass index is a measure of obesity.</p>
            <p>The formula for calculating BMI is based upon the individual's height (HEIGHT) and weight (WEIGHT).  BMI = (weight in pounds * 703)/height in inches squared.  For adults (age 20 and over), an individual with a BMI under 18.5 is considered underweight.  A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal, BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and an individual with a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. </p>
            <p>The definitions of overweight and obesity differ for adults and children and teens. For a complete definition of BMI groups for adults see: Adult BMI. For a complete definition of BMI groups for children and teens see: Children and Teen BMI.</p>
            <p>BMI was calculated with information gathered during the Eating and Health Module of the ATUS interview.  Analyses that include BMI should use EHWT as the weight.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. </p>
            <p>Employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week. Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work." Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "employed - absent." </p>
            <p>Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force. Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. </p>
            <p>Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force." Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).</p>
            <p>EMPSTAT was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Employment status was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See EMPSTAT_CPS8.  EMPSTAT_CPS8 distinguishes between not being in the labor force due to retirement, disability, or other reasons, but EMPSTAT does not.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>OCC2 reports the respondent's primary occupation.</p>
            <p>This variable provides the same information as OCC, which provides the four-digit Census occupation codes.  For the convenience of researchers who do not need the level of detail available in OCC, OCC2 collapses all occupations in the four-digit classification scheme into 22 broader occupations.  In addition, researchers who prefer even less detail may use the first two non-zero digits of OCC2 to create an occupation variable with only 10 categories.</p>
            <p>OCC2 was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Occupation information for the respondent's main job was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See OCC2_CPS8 (and OCC_CPS8).  The Armed Forces occupational category is included in OCC2_CPS8 but not in OCC2.</p>
            <p>If a respondent has another (second) job, OCC2_OJ_CPS8 reports the occupation information for that job using the same industry categories as OCC2_CPS8.  OCC_OJ_CPS8 reports occupation information for the second job using the four-digit Census industry codes.  Industry information for the second job was not collected during the ATUS interview.</p>

            <p>DIFFANY indicates whether the respondent has any physical or cognitive difficulty, as measured by an affirmative response to at least one of the CPS' six cognitive difficulties (DIFFHEAR, DIFFEYE, DIFFREM, DIFFPHYS, DIFFMOB, and DIFFCARE).</p>
            <p>DIFFANY was drawn from the final CPS interview, conducted 2-5 months before the ATUS interview. Note that despite this information being drawn from the final CPS interview, the data were actually collected in CPS interviews 1 and 5 unless the household is new to the CPS. For additional information, see BLS frequently asked questions about disability data.</p>
            <p>Researchers using these data should also note that estimates of disability prevalence from CPS are lower than estimates from other large-scale datasets.</p>
